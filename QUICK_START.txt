⚠️ ONE FINAL STEP NEEDED:

Save the Opaleon Holdings Logo Image:

1. Save your logo image (the one shown in the attachment) as:
   images/opaleon-logo.png

2. Make sure it's a PNG with transparent background
3. Recommended minimum width: 1000px for best quality

That's it! Once you save the logo, open index.html in your browser to see the results.
